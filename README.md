Processing Nine Block Patterns (and more|)
========


This is an implementation of the nine block pattern in processing.org for live visuals.
Or this how it go started and went quite far beyond that. The Project started as visual identity
for the Brussels based label http://Stainage.com/ parties.

You can have an idea of how the thing might look there :

Features :
- Sound/Beat Detection using minim FFT
- Launchpad Control
- OSC
- Presets
- control window
- extensible layer types.
- full screen mode, 2nd screen detection.

It uses a bunch of Processing libraries :
Syphon, OscP5, ControlP5, RWMidi, sDrop, toxiclibs-core, dmxP512.

The Project should run with the libraries installed in the stock Processing 
(i run on trunk processing from github). However i recommend to use eclipse or 
any other more advanced Java editor to use this due to the number of classes.
